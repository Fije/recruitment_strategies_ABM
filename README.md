# An Agent-Based Model of ants' recruitment strategies compared to their colony size

This repo holds the codebase for the ['An Agent-Based Model of ants' recruitment strategies compared to their colony size' paper](TODO). This paper was based on the paper by [Planque et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915909/pdf/pone.0011664.pdf) on Recruitment Strategies and Colony Size in Ants.

While writing this codebase, contributions where made to the [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) ABM framework:
- [[Feature Implemented] Multiprocessing BatchRunner](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/456)
- [[Bugfix] iter_neighborhood() now gives correct neighborhoods for both von Neumann and Moore](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/459)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Prerequisite libraries, frameworks, and modules can be installed through:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the correct versions of:
- matplotlib (2.0.2)
- numpy (1.12.1)
- tqdm (4.19.5)
- pandas (0.20.3)
- pathos (0.2.1)
- Mesa (0.8.2)
- SALib (1.1.3)

### Repository
The following list describes the most important files in the project and where to find them:
- **/Code**: contains all of the codebase of this project
  - **/Code/ant.py**: contains the Ant class that implements the ant's properties and updates.
  - **/Code/model.py**: contains the Environment class that implements the Environment's properties and updates.
  - **/Code/roles.py**: contains the role modules. These objects can be used to specify roles for agents.
- **/Data**: contains csv's generated by the code.
- **/Results**: contains mainly images generated by the code.
