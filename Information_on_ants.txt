How do ants’ pheromone behaviour work?


- Inactive foragers wait in the nest
- We have provided behavioral evidence that P. megacephala uses two different pheromones, a long-lasting pheromone during exploration and a short-lasting foraging pheromone during recruitment to a food source
- Some ant species make other ants act as slaves for them. Extreme forms of these exist where ant species cannot feed themselves and need these slaves to survive.
- Different kind of recruitments:
    - Tandem recruitment (A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close).,  (=learning by imitation)
    - group recruitment,
    - mass recruitment
    - Inidividual recruitment:  The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants. Like virtually all ants, they are eusocial, but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.[128]
    - Finding way back to the colony:
        - Diurnal desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis such as the Sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction as well as distance travelled. Distances travelled are measured using an internal pedometer that keeps count of the steps taken[111] and also by evaluating the movement of objects in their visual field (optical flow).[112]Directions are measured using the position of the sun.[113] They integrate this information to find the shortest route back to their nest.[114] Like all ants, they can also make use of visual landmarks when available[115] as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate.[116][117] Some species of ant are able to use the Earth's magnetic field for navigation.[118] The compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.[119][120] These polarization detectors are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum.[121] In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.

- When offered a choice between two identical food sources in the presence of exploration pheromone, the ants focused exclusively on one source in all trials (Fig.5). In contrast, in the absence of exploration pheromone this was reduced to 11 out of 15 trials (Fig.5). This again supports the idea of the exploration pheromone creating an underlying structure which increases the efficiency of recruitment when food is found
- Pheromone trails can enable a rapid mass recruitment to food discoveries, but they also impose constraints on the overall foraging efficiency of a species (Beekman et al., 2001). The characteristics of trail pheromones used, particularly their decay rate, play an important role in determining foraging efficiency and flexibility. Short-lived, volatile trails can rapidly modulate recruitment to ephemeral food sources, whereas long-lived trails will be more suited to persistent, or recurrent, food sources. Thus, trail longevity must be matched to the foraging ecology of a particular species. Indeed, trail longevity varies from minutes in Aphaenogaster albisetosus (Hölldobler et al., 1995) to days in the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes (Billen et al., 1992), which exploits permanent food sources. Even when foraging in their natural environments, species with a fixed pheromone decay rate experience a tradeoff between efficient recruitment and a flexible response to changes in the environment. For example, Goss and colleagues (Goss et al., 1989) provided Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) first with a long path between nest and food. When a shorter path was added after the ants had established a trail, in most trials the majority of ants continued to forage on the longer path. Similar results have been reported with Lasius niger (Beckers et al., 1992b). Mathematical models predict that the ants will remain on an established trail for periods longer than the evaporation rate of the pheromone because ants continue to reinforce the trail on the long path (Goss et al., 1989; Nicolis and Deneubourg, 1999; Sumpter and Pratt, 2003). Thus even short-lasting pheromone trails can, through positive feedback, result in ants becoming `trapped' in suboptimal situations

- Colony size versus collective behaviour:

T   - he prediction that follows from this hypothesis is that the larger the colony size, the less foraging is individually based and the more the individual foragers are coordinated by mass chemical communication (=pheromones).
